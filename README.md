Chat Application Project

This Java project is a chat application that demonstrates the use of non-blocking I/O and concurrency to create a client-server architecture where multiple clients can connect, send messages, and log out. It provides practical experience with advanced Java features, including NIO channels, selectors, and multi-threading.

What This Project Taught Me

Implementing a non-blocking server using Java NIO.
Handling multiple client connections concurrently.
Designing a client-server communication protocol.
Utilizing concurrency features in Java to manage client tasks.
Processing and responding to client requests asynchronously.
Getting Started

Dependencies
Java JDK 8 or higher.
Running the Application
Compile the Java files and ensure all class files are in the same directory.
Start the ChatServer by running ChatServer.class with Java.
Launch multiple instances of ChatClient by running ChatClient.class with different parameters to simulate multiple users.
Interact with the chat application through the console.
Features

Asynchronous server that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Clients can log in, send messages, and log out.
Server logs all activities, including logins, logouts, and messages.
Clients can execute tasks concurrently, demonstrating Java's concurrency and multi-threading capabilities.
